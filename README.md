# Jaseci-Ancestry


The `spouses` field is an array, so you can include multiple spouses if necessary.

## Experience

Implementing the new feature was a relatively straightforward process. We updated the `Person` class to include a `spouses` field and modified the `add_person` function to allow for the addition of spouses. We also updated the `print_tree` function to display spouse information.

We found the Jaseci documentation to be very helpful in understanding how to work with the Jaseci framework. The documentation is well-organized and includes many examples that helped us to get started quickly.

## Demo

Here is a demo video showing how to use the new spouse feature:
